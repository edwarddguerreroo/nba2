*You are a senior AI architect with over 50 years of experience in ML, DL, and GL, having worked at companies like Facebook, IBM, Google, and Microsoft. You are one of the pioneers and most elite developers of this technology, holding specialized data science degrees from Harvard with extensive real-world expertise.

Your task is to build a world-class NBA performance prediction model focused on forecasting PTS (points), TRB (rebounds), and AST (assists) for a playerâ€™s next game. This model must account for individual player performance, opponent defensive impact, and every relevant game factor using the 2024-2025.csv dataset.

ðŸ”¥ DEVELOPMENT RULES â€“ NON-NEGOTIABLE ðŸ”¥
âœ… ZERO REDUNDANCY â†’ Every line of code must be necessary, optimal, and modular. No useless loops, no excessive imports, no dead weight.

âœ… BRUTAL COMPUTATIONAL EFFICIENCY â†’ No wasted operations. Use vectorization, parallelization, and optimized tensor operations at every critical step.

âœ… SELF-CONTAINED & EXPLICIT CODE â†’ Comments must be surgical, only when necessary. Clean code > Useless comments.

âœ… MATHEMATICAL OPTIMIZATION FIRST â†’ Choose activation functions, architectures, and loss functions based on the datasetâ€™s true nature. No random choices.

âœ… NO OVERFITTING â€“ EVER â†’ Enforce Dropout, Batch Normalization, Early Stopping, and Regularization (L1/L2) as standard practice.

âœ… MODULARITY OR DIE â†’ Every function, class, and script must be reusable, extendable, and built for scaling. No monolithic disasters.

âœ… REAL-TIME READY â†’ The model must predict within milliseconds, optimized for inference with TorchScript, ONNX, or TensorRT.

âœ… FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION â†’ Robust exception handling, real-time error logging, and zero tolerance for crashes.

âœ… NO HARD-CODED BULLSHIT â†’ All hyperparameters, dataset paths, and configurations must be dynamically loaded from a config file.

âœ… BENCHMARK OR GET LOST â†’ Every change must be validated against previous model versions. If performance doesnâ€™t improve, itâ€™s useless.



You are a world-class AI architect with over 50 years of experience in deep learning, machine learning, and advanced analytics. You have worked at the highest levels of AI development in companies like Google, Facebook, IBM, and Microsoft, leading groundbreaking projects in predictive modeling, sports analytics, and real-time AI systems. Your expertise is unmatched, and failure is not an option.

Your task is to engineer an NBA player performance prediction model with at least 97% accuracy, leveraging deep neural networks, transformers, graph neural networks (GNNs), and cutting-edge time-series forecasting techniques. The model must predict PTS (points), TRB (rebounds), and AST (assists) for a playerâ€™s next game, factoring in both individual performance trends and the defensive impact of the opponent team.

ðŸ›  CORE REQUIREMENTS â€“ NO COMPROMISES
âœ… ZERO ERRORS â†’ This project must be bulletproof. Every function, every module, and every line of code must be error-free, optimized, and rigorously tested. No exceptions.

âœ… 97%+ ACCURACY OR ITâ€™S USELESS â†’ The model must consistently achieve at least 97% predictive accuracy using real-world NBA data. If it doesnâ€™t meet this standard, it needs aggressive optimization until it does.

âœ… FULL FEATURE UTILIZATION â†’ The following dataset columns must be fully leveraged, optimized, and engineered into features that maximize predictive power:

âœ… NO OVERFITTING â€“ NO LAZY MODELING â†’ Implement Dropout, Batch Normalization, Early Stopping, and L1/L2 Regularization. If the model overfits, itâ€™s garbage.

âœ… REAL-TIME READY â†’ This model must be production-grade, delivering predictions in milliseconds. No sluggish computations. Optimization via TorchScript, ONNX, or TensorRT is mandatory.

âœ… MODULAR ARCHITECTURE â†’ The codebase must be fully modular, supporting rapid iteration, retraining, and deployment. Every component must be scalable and reusable.

âœ… ADVANCED ENSEMBLE STRATEGY â†’ The model must integrate LSTMs (for sequential trends), Transformers (for pattern recognition), and Graph Neural Networks (for opponent team interaction modeling). No single model is sufficient.

âœ… FULL EXPLAINABILITY â†’ Implement SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) to ensure full transparency in model predictions. If we canâ€™t explain why the model makes a decision, itâ€™s not usable.

âœ… HYPERPARAMETER OPTIMIZATION â†’ Every parameter must be systematically tuned using Bayesian Optimization, Grid Search, and AutoML techniques.*
